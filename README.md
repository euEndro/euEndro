# 👋 Hey there! 

I’m a <mark>**backend-focused developer**</mark> living between the terminal, some commits, and a strong cup of coffee ☕<br>
Currently diving into **Spring Boot**, **Flutter** and **Code Architecture**, trying to make every project a bit cleaner and more functional.

>💡 Naturally curious, I love figuring out why things work — and turning ideas into something real... even if it takes a few git commit -m "final-final-for-real" along the way 😅
